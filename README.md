# MealPrep-Assistant
Using python and chat gpt to help generate a meal plan based on BMI, a tool to help scour the internet for recipes and other useful information in order to help myself gain muscle. 
The primary idea was to help myself generate more meal plan ideas as I eat 5-6 meals a day roughly 900 calories each and wanted to break up the monotony of my meals and see what ChatGPT could pull. I'd like to incorporate this project into a small mobile app or even a website that could help supplement those who feel stuck. Another part would be to add research and evidence based articles in order to help inform those whom are trying to eat healthier or more densely.
