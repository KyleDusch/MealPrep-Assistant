# MealPrep-Assistant
Using Python, ChatGPT and skills learned from my Prompt Engineering course a meal plan based on BMI was generated. This tool is useful to help scour the internet for recipes and other useful information in order to help myself gain muscle.


The primary idea was to help myself generate more meal plan ideas as I eat 5-6 meals a day roughly 900 calories each and wanted to break up the monotony of my meals and utilize ChatGPT for unique blends of recipes. I try and eat various cuisines all within the Anti-Inflammation Diet in order to keep my body as Cancer and Dementia resistant as possible. Another part would be to add research and evidence based articles in order to help inform those whom are trying to eat healthier or more densely.
