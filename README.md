# MealPrep-Assistant
Using Python, Chat Gpt and skills learned from my Prompt Engineering course a meal plan based on BMI was generated. This tool is useful to help scour the internet for recipes and other useful information in order to help myself gain muscle. Jupyter Notebooks was used for the IDE. 


The primary idea was to help myself generate more meal plan ideas as I eat 5-6 meals a day roughly 900 calories each and wanted to break up the monotony of my meals and see what ChatGPT could pull for like different recipes. I'd like to incorporate this project into a small mobile app or even a website that could help supplement those who feel stuck. Another part would be to add research and evidence based articles in order to help inform those whom are trying to eat healthier or more densely.


My next improvement will to be developing a webscraping function for same caloric amount, nutrition amount while generating different recipes, in order to break up monotony of bulking, cutting or maintain physique.
