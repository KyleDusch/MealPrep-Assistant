# MealPrep-Assistant
Using Python, ChatGPT and skills learned from my Prompt Engineering course a meal plan based on BMI was generated. This tool is useful to help scour the internet for recipes and other useful information in order to help myself gain muscle. This was placed in the file No Python Code Result page.


The primary idea was to help myself generate more meal plan ideas as I eat 5-6 meals a day roughly 900 calories each and wanted to break up the monotony of my meals and utilize ChatGPT for unique blends of recipes. I try and eat various cuisines all within the Anti-Inflammation Diet in order to keep my body as Cancer and Dementia resistant as possible. Another part would be to add research and evidence based articles in order to help inform those whom are trying to eat healthier or more densely. 

There is a second file to this project which would what the meal plan would look like if designed with python entirely generated by ChatGPT this demonstrates the OpenAI's versatility and efficiency to effecitvely solve a task while using a set of parameters such as only writing the program in a programming language script such as Python. All of this was achieved with a single command line prompt of code, which can be further improved using subsequent more specfic commands such as, import data set from a website or add an interactive function of user name, and which cuisine the individual would like to try.  This is found under the file code in the files portion of the main repository.
